# isEven
isEven is an extermely difficult and complicated application, whose goal is to identify if given number is even or not. With exterme luck and some effort we have come up with a technique which is able to identify given number is even or not in the range of 1 to 1000.
Note: This is extremely complex task and require serious thinking and understanding of subject and only subject matter expert are able to determine if given algorithm is correct or not for given number. So if user provide value out of this range this application is bound to fail.
We're proud to release this application.

## How to use
Even though this task is fairly complex. We've made it easier for user to use this application. To use it user can simply execute the script with number they want to determine is even or not and we'll provide answer.
```bash
$ python3 is_even.py 21
```

Note: Please note this application provide information about number being even or not. Identify odd number is another complex task and will require a dedicated application. Our team is working hard and will soon release `is_odd` application as well.
