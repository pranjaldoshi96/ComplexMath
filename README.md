# ComplexMath
We at complex math strive to solve some of the worlds most complex problems. We're group of Math lunatics who have spend their entire career to find solution of problems which seems impossible for human for many years. As of now we've solved identifying a given number is even or not. Until now this problem was so complex no one even tried their best. Here at ComplexMath we achieved this by spending our years of study to solve this. 

## Contribution Guideline
We're looking for math genius who were named prodigy before they were born to contribute to our project. If you identify any problem that seems hard enough register a problem discuss it with us and create a PR with solution. We only accept best of the best solution. For any problem create a separate directory and push your solution there.

Note: At this point we've solved problem called is_even which provides information about number being even or not. Identify odd number is another complex task and will require a dedicated application. Our team is working hard and will soon release `is_odd` application as well.
