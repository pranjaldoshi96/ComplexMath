## About

Welcome to ComplexMath, the most advanced mathematical library ever conceived by human minds. After decades of research and billions in funding, our team of elite mathematicians, quantum physicists, and coffee addicts has finally cracked the code to revolutionize basic arithmetic.

## Features

Our groundbreaking algorithms include:

`IsEven` - we've solved problem called is_even which provides information about number being even or not. Identify odd number is another complex task and will require a dedicated application. Our team is working hard and will soon release is_odd application as well.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions from fellow math visionaries. If you've discovered a way to make addition take O(n^2) time or have a 50-step process for checking equality, we want to hear from you!

## Testimonials
